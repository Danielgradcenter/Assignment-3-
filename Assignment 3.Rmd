## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Define the character vector
Fruit_data <- c("bell pepper", "bilberry", "blackberry", "blood orange",
                "blueberry", "cantaloupe", "chili pepper", "cloudberry",
                "elderberry", "lime", "lychee", "mulberry",
                "olive", "salal berry")





```

```{r cars 2}

# Load the stringr package
library(stringr)

# Example vector of words
words <- c("madam", "Heart", "church", "BeetJuice", "eggs",
           "Love", "Gym", "Icecream", "poop",
           "bed", "computer", "Homework")

# 1. Words that start and end with the same character
pattern1 <- "^(.)(.*)\\1$"
matches1 <- str_subset(words, pattern1)
cat("Words that start and end with the same character:\n")
print(matches1)

# 2. Words that contain a repeated pair of letters
pattern2 <- "([A-Za-z][A-Za-z]).*\\1"
matches2 <- str_subset(words, pattern2)
cat("\nWords that contain a repeated pair of letters:\n")
print(matches2)

# 3. Words that contain one letter repeated in at least three places
pattern3 <- "([A-Za-z]).*\\1.*\\1"
matches3 <- str_subset(words, pattern3)
cat("\nWords that contain one letter repeated in at least three places:\n")
print(matches3)





```





```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
